# Agentic RAG Chatbot

## Project Overview
The Agentic RAG Chatbot is an advanced conversational AI system designed to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this chatbot utilizes an intelligent agent that dynamically decides whether to use a retriever for information gathering and selects the most suitable retriever when required. Built using LangChain, Pydantic, and Gemini, this project demonstrates cutting-edge techniques in modular and adaptive AI-driven conversation systems.

## Features
- **Agentic Decision-Making**: The chatbot employs an agent to determine whether a retriever is necessary for a given query.
- **Dynamic Retriever Selection**: If retrieval is required, the agent identifies and uses the most appropriate retriever based on the context.
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Designed to handle diverse use cases with high performance and adaptability.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built using LangChain, Pydantic, and Gemini for seamless integration and customization.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: To handle the chaining of language processing tasks and retrieval logic.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and management.
- **Gemini**: To enhance the modelâ€™s retrieval and generative capabilities.
